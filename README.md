This project proposes a Natural Language Processing (NLP) solution tailored to 
address the communication barriers faced by individuals with hearing impairments 
by converting spoken language into sign language in real-time. The proposed 
system leverages advanced NLP techniques to translation across diverse linguistic 
contexts. Initially, speech input is captured through a microphone and converted 
into electrical energy, which is further digitized(converted to 0s and 1s) using an 
analog-to-digital converter in the computer. Subsequently, employing algorithms 
such as Neural Networks or Hidden Markov Models which is found in the 
SpeechRecognition module in python, the digital data is transformed into textual 
form, enabling computational analysis and linguistic processing. The Textual data 
is then mapped on to the corresponding sign language/ Our solution endeavors to 
achieve efficiency in bridging the gap between spoken and signed communication 
modalities
